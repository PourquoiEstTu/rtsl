- We met together to go through our proposal feedback and plan out how we will split up the SRS, we split up specific sections amongst ourselves and decided to meet again later in the
week to figure out the other parts (the more complex parts)
- Our group also decided to set up a when2meet so we can find the best time for all of us to meet consistently every week

parts of the project
