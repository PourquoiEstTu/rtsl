Project Pitch:
Hey guys, here is an updated pitch with a list of planned features and some ideas for games

An application that translates a string of ASL gestures into complete sentences that has features and minigames which engage the user in trying out sign language.

Plan:
- Create a model trained on public ASL data
- Use computer vision to detect and translate sign language into text in real time

Features:
- Has list of predetermined day-to-day scenarios, engages users by having them respond with sign language (EXTENSION: making the scenarios itself use sign language, making users create their own scenarios by giving ideas to an AI)
- Extension: Using facial expressions to denote tone and grammar
- Extension: With facial expressions, using text to speech software to say the sentence with the correct emotion 

Create games that use ASL:
    - Duolingo-like mode (Given a video of sign language and need to write it in English, given some text and need to convert into sign language by signing it)
    - Image responder, flashes an image on screen and you have to sign it, there’s a time limit and if you don’t sign it in time, you lose (Geo guesser inspired)

Note: 
- The focus is not on learning sign language fluently, its to learn a bit and to have fun engaging with sign language
