Agenda:

- We met with Dr. Welch today to ask him for advice regarding NLP on how to approach our project. He provided us with a ton of resources and gave some advice regarding training, suggesting to train on sentence data rather than word-level data.
- After the meeting, we figured out a day to do meetings for the winter term, and also picked a secondary day for meetings in case it is needed. We decided to stick with Thursdays and Sundays for meetings.
