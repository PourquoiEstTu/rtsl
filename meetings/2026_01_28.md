Agenda:

- We met with the professor today to discuss the current state of our project.
- The professor suggested that we compare with other models and look into the accepted level of accuracy / validation for our problem.
- We also asked about how to host our project (whether to use the university's servers or an external server), and he said either method is fine (there were pros and cons to both approaches).
- The professor also mentioned that in our next meeting, he would like to see a deep dive on the back end, training, and testing side of our model.
