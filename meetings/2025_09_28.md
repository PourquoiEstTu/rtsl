Agenda:
- We met together to go through our proposal feedback and plan out how we will split up the SRS, we split up specific sections amongst ourselves and decided to meet again later in the
week to figure out the other parts (the more complex parts)
- Our group also decided to set up a when2meet so we can find the best time for all of us to meet consistently every week
- We decided to meet every Friday, and we have identified other days to meet if necessary. The when2meet allows us to schedule sub-meetings with other members of the team for specific 
parts of the project
